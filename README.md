### Topic

+ Spectral analysis

  > Spectral analysis is carried out to describe how variation in a time series may be accounted for by cyclic components. This may also be referred to as "Frequency Domain". With this an estimate of the spectrum over a range of frequencies can be obtained and periodic components in a noisy environment can be separated out.

+ Intervention Analysis

  > Time Series Intervention Analysis (or Interrupted Time Series Analysis) can explain if there is a certain event that occurs that changes a time series. This technique is used a lot of the time in planned experimental analysis.
  >
  > The basic question is "Has an event had an impact on a time series?"
